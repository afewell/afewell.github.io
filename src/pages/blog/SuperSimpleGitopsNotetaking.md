When we are under tight deadlines it can be very hard to document each step while building a project and often results in many things not being well documented or easily reusable. This also impacts smaller or personal projects usually even more as its even harder to find the extra time needed to document things. 

But what if you had a note-taking solution that could be super fast and simple but still keep things organized and useful even when rushed? I have been trying to optimize and automate my toolset and now have a solution that works amazingly well for me so I wanted to share the details. This video shows how I use github projects for part of my overall solution and also shows a preview of the solution I use for automated semantic versioning, packaging documentation and gitops maintenance which I will fully detail in subsequent videos.

I am working on an updated blog site and so currently dont have an embedded youtube viewer setup, but please checkout the video for an explanation and demo: [https://youtu.be/8SMBHjBB4vg](https://youtu.be/8SMBHjBB4vg)

I have spent a fair amount of time wrestling with SSL certs, and its another one of those areas where, experience helps, but dealing with them is still a huge pain. 

One of the biggest reasons why this area has been such a pain for me is that there are varying instructions to be found online, lots of different configurations that may or may not work, or may work in some cases but not others. There are a number of times I have gotten a self-signed CA certificate working, definitely working, but only for some things, as some details of cert formats arent ratified and ssl clients can behave differently. 

I had to reconfigure a lab to use a private CA today, and once again find conflicting documentation between the host OS, openssl docs, and Harbor docs, as to how exactly I should set up my CA. I dont think there could be any clear answer as to how to best do this or even if there is a solution that will work perfectly, as I have several components in my stack that use different methods for dealing with self-signed certs. 

So while I did not expect a perfect answer, I did need lots of detailed, nuanced explanations to help me understand the many many different configuration options and help me weigh the pros and cons as to what I would keep in my initial and subsequent tests. 

I was extremely impressed by the quality of responses - although it is worth noting that, if you look at the last 2 interactions I had with ChatGPT below, that it provided me with a recommended command, but it did not include an optional parameter that probably should have been included. After I asked it about the missing parameter, it informed me that it would be a good practice to include it, so much so that its own response stated that the solution may not even work in many cases without including the parameter. 

Check out the whole response below:

## What I asked ChatGPT

what is the difference between this command: "openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650" and this command: openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -sha512 -days 3650 \
-subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=example/OU=Personal/CN=yourdomain.com" \
-key ca.key \
-out ca.crt"

### ChatGPT Response

Both of these commands are used to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) and a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL.

The first command generates a self-signed certificate with the following options:

* req: specifies that a certificate request should be created.
* new: specifies that a new certificate request should be created.
* x509: specifies that a self-signed certificate should be created.
* extensions v3_ca: specifies that the certificate should include the v3_ca extension, which specifies that the certificate is a certificate authority (CA) certificate.
* keyout cakey.pem: specifies the file where the private key should be output.
* out cacert.pem: specifies the file where the self-signed certificate should be output.
* days 3650: specifies the number of days the certificate should be valid for.

The second command generates a self-signed certificate with the following options:

* req: specifies that a certificate request should be created.
* x509: specifies that a self-signed certificate should be created.
* new: specifies that a new certificate request should be created.
* nodes: specifies that the private key should not be encrypted with a password.
* sha512: specifies the hash algorithm to use when signing the certificate.
* days 3650: specifies the number of days the certificate should be valid for.
* subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=example/OU=Personal/CN=yourdomain.com": specifies the subject name for the certificate in the /name=value format.
* key ca.key: specifies the file containing the private key to use when signing the certificate.
* out ca.crt: specifies the file where the self-signed certificate should be output.

## What I asked ChatGPT

how does the first command work without any subject

### ChatGPT Response

In the first command you provided, the subject name for the certificate is not specified. This means that the subject name will be prompted for when the command is run. OpenSSL will display a prompt asking for the subject's distinguished name (DN), which is a set of attributes that identify the subject of the certificate. The attributes that make up the DN can include the country (C), state or province (ST), locality (L), organization (O), organizational unit (OU), and common name (CN). The user will be asked to enter values for these attributes at the command line.

For example, when the command is run, the user might see a prompt like this:

```sh
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]: 
State or Province Name (full name) []: 
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]: 
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]: 
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: 
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:
```

The user would then enter the desired values for each attribute, and those values would be used as the subject name for the certificate.

Alternatively, the subject name can be specified as a command line option using the -subj flag. For example:

```sh
openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Example Inc./CN=example.com"
```

This would specify the subject name for the certificate as /C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Example Inc./CN=example.com, without prompting the user for input.

## What I asked ChatGPT

can you please explain the following command, including what is the difference when you include the v3 extensions file or not? openssl x509 -req -sha512 -days 3650 \
    -extfile v3.ext \
    -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
    -in yourdomain.com.csr \
    -out yourdomain.com.crt

### ChatGPT Response

The `openssl x509` command is used to sign a certificate signing request (CSR) and create a certificate. The options used in the command you provided are as follows:

* req: specifies that a certificate should be created from a certificate request (CSR).
* sha512: specifies the hash algorithm to use when signing the certificate.
* days 3650: specifies the number of days the certificate should be valid for.
* extfile v3.ext: specifies a file containing additional X509 v3 extensions to include in the certificate. These extensions can be used to add additional information or specify additional constraints on the certificate.
* CA ca.crt: specifies the file containing the CA certificate to use when signing the certificate.
* CAkey ca.key: specifies the file containing the private key corresponding to the CA certificate.
* CAcreateserial: specifies that a serial number should be created for the certificate. The serial number is a unique identifier for the certificate and is typically used to differentiate between multiple certificates issued by the same CA.
* in yourdomain.com.csr: specifies the file containing the CSR to sign.
* out yourdomain.com.crt: specifies the file where the signed certificate should be output.

If the `extfile` option is not included, then no additional X509 v3 extensions will be included in the certificate. The certificate will only contain the extensions that are specified in the CSR, if any.

If the `extfile` option is included, then the extensions specified in the file specified by `extfile` will be added to the certificate in addition to any extensions that are specified in the CSR. This can be used to add additional information or specify additional constraints on the certificate beyond what is included in the CSR.

## What I asked ChatGPT

in the following v3.ext file, do these options need to be in an extension file or can I include them in the csr?
cat > v3.ext &lt;<-EOF
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1=yourdomain.com
DNS.2=yourdomain
DNS.3=hostname
EOF

### ChatGPT Response

The options listed in the v3.ext file you provided are X509 v3 extensions that can be included in a certificate or a certificate signing request (CSR). These extensions can be used to add additional information or specify additional constraints on the certificate.

In general, the options listed in the v3.ext file can be included either in the CSR or in an extension file like v3.ext. The choice of whether to include the options in the CSR or in an extension file will depend on your specific requirements and how you want to generate the certificate.

If you want to include the options in the CSR, you can do so by using the -reqexts flag when generating the CSR with the openssl req command. For example:

```
openssl req -new -sha512 -nodes \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Example Inc./CN=example.com" \
  -reqexts v3_req \
  -keyout yourdomain.com.key \
  -out yourdomain.com.csr
```

The v3_req extension section would contain the options listed in the v3.ext file.

Alternatively, if you want to include the options in an extension file, you can use the extfile flag when signing the CSR with the openssl x509 command. For example:

```
openssl x509 -req -sha512 -days 3650 \
 -extfile v3.ext \
 -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
 -in yourdomain.com.csr \
 -out yourdomain.com.crt
```

In this case, the options listed in the v3.ext file will be added to the certificate in addition to any extensions that are specified in the CSR.

## What I asked ChatGPT

can you show me how to include the options from the v3.ext file in the v3_req extension section?

### ChatGPT Response

To include the options from the v3.ext file in the v3_req extension section, you will need to copy the contents of the v3.ext file into the v3_req extension section in the configuration file used by the openssl req command.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```sh
cat > openssl.cnf <<-EOF
[req]
prompt = no
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C=US
ST=California
L=Mountain View
O=Example Inc.
CN=example.com

[v3_req]
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1=yourdomain.com
DNS.2=yourdomain
DNS.3=hostname
EOF
```

Then, you can use the openssl req command with the -config flag to specify the configuration file and the -reqexts flag to specify the extension section to use:

```
openssl req -new -sha512 -nodes \
  -config openssl.cnf \
  -reqexts v3_req \
  -keyout yourdomain.com.key \
  -out yourdomain.com.csr

```
This will generate a CSR with the options from the v3.ext file included in the v3_req extension section.

## What I asked ChatGPT

how can I create a private CA and generate a wildcard certificate for a domain

### ChatGPT Response

To create a private certificate authority (CA) and generate a wildcard certificate for a domain, you can follow these steps:


1. Create a private key for the CA:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
```

2. Create a self-signed CA certificate:
```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

3. Create a configuration file for the certificate signing request (CSR):
```bash
cat > openssl.cnf <<-EOF
[req]
prompt = no
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C=US
ST=California
L=Mountain View
O=Example Inc.
CN=*.example.com

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1=*.example.com
EOF
```

4. Create a private key for the certificate:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out yourdomain.com.key 2048
```

5. Create a CSR:
```bash
openssl req -new -sha512 -nodes \
  -config openssl.cnf \
  -key yourdomain.com.key \
  -out yourdomain.com.csr
```

6. Sign the CSR with the CA to create the certificate:
```bash
openssl x509 -req -sha512 -days 3650 \
  -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -in yourdomain.com.csr \
  -out yourdomain.com.crt
```

This will create a private CA and a wildcard certificate for the domain *.example.com. The certificate will be valid for 3650 days and will be signed by the private CA.

## What I asked ChatGPT

should the command to generate the self-signed CA certificate include the "extensions v3_ca" option or not?

### ChatGPT Response

In general, it is a good practice to include the extensions v3_ca option when generating a self-signed certificate authority (CA) certificate using the openssl req command. This option specifies that the certificate should include the v3_ca extension, which specifies that the certificate is a CA certificate.

Here is an example of how you can generate a self-signed CA certificate with the extensions v3_ca option:
```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

This will create a self-signed CA certificate with the v3_ca extension included. The certificate can then be used to sign other certificates.

It is important to include the v3_ca extension in a CA certificate, as this helps to identify the certificate as a CA certificate and ensures that it is trusted by clients. Without the v3_ca extension, the certificate may not be recognized as a CA certificate and may not be trusted by clients.

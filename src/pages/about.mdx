            Hi, pleased to meet you!

            My name is Art Fewell, and I work on the Tanzu technical marketing team at VMware. 

            I love learning and getting hands on with new tech, but more than that, I am driven to learn from and share my own experiences with our awesome community. I couldn't have gotten anywhere without this community, and my greatest work passion is to help others learn things they find valuable and fulfilling, and help others advance their careers and achieve their goals.

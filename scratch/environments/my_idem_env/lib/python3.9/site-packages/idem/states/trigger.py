    A state to represent a trigger. A trigger will be a dictionary of key-values,
    which when changed, can be used to trigger another state. The dictionary can
    hold values that are user defined e.g. last_run_id: {{ range(1, 51) | random }}
    or it can hold values from the output of a different state as supported in arg
    binding e.g. user_name: ${aws.iam.user:aws_iam_user.extension-jenkins:user_name}.

    Note: Triggers dictionary can hold values which won't change over the course
    of multiple execution. The example below is a constantly changing trigger state.

    :param ctx:
    :param name: The name of the state
    :param resource_id: The resource_id to represent this trigger in ESM. Its an internal id to track
                 whether this resource has run or not.
    :param triggers: The dictionary to hold key-value pairs

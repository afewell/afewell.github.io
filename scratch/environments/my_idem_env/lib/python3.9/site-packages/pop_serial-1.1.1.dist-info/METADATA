Pop-serial provides a standardized interface for serializing and de-serializing data.
This project serves as an app-merge component for larger projects

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.
